#+CATEGORY: bitdecode
* bitdecode project progress
* ---------------------------- Dated notes ----------------------------
* <2014-12-24 Wed> Created this project
* <2014-12-24 Wed> Managing modules
  - I'm having trouble using the inifile module, even though it's part
    of the Tcl standard library.  The fix is to copy the inifil
    package directory from C:\Tcl\tcllib-trunk\tcllib-trunk\modules, or
    wherever your tcllib is stored, to a lib directory in the projec
    directory.  You can then add the line
  - lappend ::auto_path ./lib/inifile
  - ...to your script, followed by the line
  - package require inifile
  - ...to load the module.  Look in ini.tcl to see which version
    you're using.
