## Installation ##

Installation is via a self-contained
[Starpack](http://equi4.com/starkit/) executable file.  There is no need to install
Tcl, Tk, or any dependencies.  Further, running the Starpack will
leave no installation-related files behind.  You can uninstall the
program by deleting the Starpack.

### 32-bit (and 64-bit) Windows ###

Find the self-contained Starpack in the subdirectory of its version
number.  For example, the 1.1 version's Starpack is
[here](implement/starpacks/1.1/win32/bitdecode.exe).
