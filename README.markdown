## Installation ##

Installation is via a self-contained
[Starpack](http://equi4.com/starkit/) executable file.  There is no need to install
Tcl, Tk, or any dependencies.  Further, running the Starpack will
leave no installation-related files behind.  You can uninstall the
program by deleting the Starpack.

Find release binaries by clicking on the **releases** button:
