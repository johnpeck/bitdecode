## Installation ##

Installation is via a self-contained
[Starpack](http://equi4.com/starkit/) executable file.  There is no need to install
Tcl, Tk, or any dependencies.  Further, running the Starpack will
leave no installation-related files behind.  You can uninstall the
program by deleting the Starpack.

Find release binaries by clicking on the **releases** button:

The executable Starpacks are also included in the zipped-up source
releases in the `implement/starpacks/` directory.


### 32-bit (and 64-bit) Windows ###

Download the release Starpack ending with `win32-ix86.exe` (using the
**releases** button described above).  This file can be run from any
directory, and will create configuration and log files in that same
directory.

## Customizing the bit labels ##

To change the default bit labels, open up the configuration file
created in the executable's directory:

Change the bit names as needed.  The program won't change your bit
names unless you completely delete the configuration file -- then it
will create a new file from scratch.
